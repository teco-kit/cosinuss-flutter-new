# Update

# Cosinuss° One Flutter Example

A minimal working example showing how to use the Cosinuss° One earbuds with Flutter to obtain heart rate, body temperature, accelerometer and raw PPG data.


## Before you start
Make sure you have Flutter installed as introduced in the Mobile Computing and IoT lecture.

Also make sure flutter_blue_plus is installed.

## Note
Currently all the required relevant code is inside the `main.dart` file (`lib > main.dart`). You may want to consider moving the BLE connection specific code into a seperate file to organize your final application better. Also this example only includes minimal error handling which you should improve for your final application.
